## General info
This project includes the Limited Symmetric Rank 1 
Trust Region (LSR1-TR) optimizer. The algorithm 
was implemented using the Pytorch library. 
Some components were taken from the source code 
of the LBFGS implementation of Pytorch. 
Furthermore, we adopted a small deep learning model
to evaluate this algorithm. 
The algorithm is tested on the MNIST dataset. 
This dataset contains 28x28 images of handwritten 
digits and an associated label. 
This implementation can be used for any deep learning problem. 
It is also possible to switch to the GPU without any problems.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* torch version : 1.13.0
* torchvision version : 0.14.0
* tqdm version : 4.64.1

The library torch is generally used for Deep Learning models,
therefore it is obvious to implement all functions in torch. 
Torch also provides interfaces for the use of a GPU by cuda. 
The MNIST data can be easily downloaded and used through 
torchvision. We use the library tqdm for aesthetic reasons 
to present a loading bar for the state of the epoch. 

## Setup with Google Colab
It is highly recommended to run the algorithm through 
Google Colab, we have created a corresponding notebook. 
This can be opened via the following link:

If Google Colab is not desired and this is to be run 
locally some steps are necessary. 
First, the entire project should be downloaded using git.


## Install all requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Settings
